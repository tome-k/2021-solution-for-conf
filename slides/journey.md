# The whole journey

<ul>
  <li>Started answering random questions</li>
  <li v-click>Quickly moved to answer Vue questions because I'm not that good at Java ðŸ˜‚</li>
  <li v-click>Sometime in April, focused heavily on Nuxt ones when <a href="https://twitter.com/Atinux">@Atinux</a> told me that I was a beast ðŸ’ª</li>
  <li v-click>Getting some juicy bounties to earn more privileges (deleted questions, edit)</li>
  <li v-click>Helped on other places on the platform (editing, flagging, voting and reviews)</li>
  <li v-click>Tried to become the #1 answerer on Nuxt-specific questions</li>
</ul>

<!--
- Codesandbox was pretty useful to explain things
- but spending time reproducing Vuetify's configuration was taking a lot of time
- test directory on my terminal
- filters on questions (Bounties, Comfort, Vue)
- how reviews do work
